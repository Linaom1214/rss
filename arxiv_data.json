    "title": "Robust infrared small target detection using self-supervised and a contrario paradigms",
    "author": "Alina Ciocarlan, Sylvie Le H\u00e9garat-Mascle, Sidonie Lefebvre, Arnaud Woiselle",
    "summary": "Detecting small targets in infrared images poses significant challenges in defense applications due to the presence of complex backgrounds and the small size of the targets. Traditional object detection methods often struggle to balance high detection rates with low false alarm rates, especially when dealing with small objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines a contrario paradigm with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to improve Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). On the one hand, the integration of an a contrario criterion into a YOLO detection head enhances feature map responses for small and unexpected objects while effectively controlling false alarms. On the other hand, we explore SSL techniques to overcome the challenges of limited annotated data, common in IRSTD tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several representative SSL strategies for their effectiveness in improving small object detection performance. Our findings show that instance discrimination methods outperform masked image modeling strategies when applied to YOLO-based small object detection. Moreover, the combination of the a contrario and SSL paradigms leads to significant performance improvements, narrowing the gap with state-of-the-art segmentation methods and even outperforming them in frugal settings. This two-pronged approach offers a robust solution for improving IRSTD performance, particularly under challenging conditions.",

    "author": "Chen Hu, Yian Huang, Kexuan Li, Luping Zhang, Yiming Zhu, Yufei Peng, Tian Pu, Zhenming Peng",
    "summary": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is widely used in civilian and military applications. However, IRSTD encounters several challenges, including the tendency for small and dim targets to be obscured by complex backgrounds. To address this issue, we propose the Gradient Network (GaNet), which aims to extract and preserve edge and gradient information of small targets. GaNet employs the Gradient Transformer (GradFormer) module, simulating central difference convolutions (CDC) to extract and integrate gradient features with deeper features. Furthermore, we propose a global feature extraction model (GFEM) that offers a comprehensive perspective to prevent the network from focusing solely on details while neglecting the background information. We compare the network with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, and the results demonstrate that our method performs effectively.

    "title": "The Disparate Benefits of Deep Ensembles",
    "author": "Kajetan Schweighofer, Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez, Sepp Hochreiter, Nuria Oliver",
    "summary": "Ensembles of Deep Neural Networks, Deep Ensembles, are widely used as a simple way to boost predictive performance. However, their impact on algorithmic fairness is not well understood yet. Algorithmic fairness investigates how a model's performance varies across different groups, typically defined by protected attributes such as age, gender, or race. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the performance gains from Deep Ensembles and fairness. Our analysis reveals that they unevenly favor different groups in what we refer to as a disparate benefits effect. We empirically investigate this effect with Deep Ensembles applied to popular facial analysis and medical imaging datasets, where protected group attributes are given and find that it occurs for multiple established group fairness metrics, including statistical parity and equal opportunity. Furthermore, we identify the per-group difference in predictive diversity of ensemble members as the potential cause of the disparate benefits effect. Finally, we evaluate different approaches to reduce unfairness due to the disparate benefits effect. Our findings show that post-processing is an effective method to mitigate this unfairness while preserving the improved performance of Deep Ensembles.",

    "title": "Deep Generative Models Unveil Patterns in Medical Images Through Vision-Language Conditioning",
    "author": "Xiaodan Xing, Junzhi Ning, Yang Nan, Guang Yang",
    "summary": "Deep generative models have significantly advanced medical imaging analysis by enhancing dataset size and quality. Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models. All codes are https://github.com/junzhin/DGM-VLC.",

    "title": "RemoteDet-Mamba: A Hybrid Mamba-CNN Network for Multi-modal Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images",
    "author": "Kejun Ren, Xin Wu, Lianming Xu, Li Wang",
    "summary": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely applied in fields such as emergency response, owing to its advantages of rapid information acquisition and low cost. However, due to the effects of shooting distance and imaging mechanisms, the objects in the images present challenges such as small size, dense distribution, and low inter-class differentiation. To this end, we propose a multimodal remote sensing detection network that employs a quad-directional selective scanning fusion strategy called RemoteDet-Mamba. RemoteDet-Mamba simultaneously facilitates the learning of single-modal local features and the integration of patch-level global features across modalities, enhancing the distinguishability for small objects and utilizing local information to improve discrimination between different classes. Additionally, the use of Mamba's serial processing significantly increases detection speed. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RemoteDet-Mamba, which achieves superior detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter count.",

    "author": "Hongfan Gao, Wangmeng Shen, Xiangfei Qiu, Ronghui Xu, Jilin Hu, Bin Yang",
    "summary": "Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability to estimate uncertainty of imputation results. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.",

    "author": "Daniel Wolf, Tristan Payer, Catharina Silvia Lisson, Christoph Gerhard Lisson, Meinrad Beer, Michael G\u00f6tz, Timo Ropinski",
    "summary": "Self-supervised pre-training of deep learning models with contrastive learning is a widely used technique in image analysis. Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.",

    "title": "Ultrasound matrix imaging for transcranial in-vivo localization microscopy",
    "author": "Flavien Bureau, Louise Denis, Antoine Coudert, Mathias Fink, Olivier Couture, Alexandre Aubry",
    "summary": "Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains impacted by wave-front distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to those fundamental issues. As an experimental proof-of-concept, an in-vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheeps. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to drastically enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and non-ionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.",

    "title": "MambaSCI: Efficient Mamba-UNet for Quad-Bayer Patterned Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging",
    "author": "Zhenghao Pan, Haijin Zeng, Jiezhang Cao, Yongyong Chen, Kai Zhang, Yong Xu",
    "summary": "Color video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) employs computational imaging techniques to capture multiple sequential video frames in a single Bayer-patterned measurement. With the increasing popularity of quad-Bayer pattern in mainstream smartphone cameras for capturing high-resolution videos, mobile photography has become more accessible to a wider audience. However, existing color video SCI reconstruction algorithms are designed based on the traditional Bayer pattern. When applied to videos captured by quad-Bayer cameras, these algorithms often result in color distortion and ineffective demosaicing, rendering them impractical for primary equipment. To address this challenge, we propose the MambaSCI method, which leverages the Mamba and UNet architectures for efficient reconstruction of quad-Bayer patterned color video SCI. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first algorithm for quad-Bayer patterned SCI reconstruction, and also the initial application of the Mamba model to this task. Specifically, we customize Residual-Mamba-Blocks, which residually connect the Spatial-Temporal Mamba (STMamba), Edge-Detail-Reconstruction (EDR) module, and Channel Attention (CA) module. Respectively, STMamba is used to model long-range spatial-temporal dependencies with linear complexity, EDR is for better edge-detail reconstruction, and CA is used to compensate for the missing channel information interaction in Mamba model. Experiments demonstrate that MambaSCI surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational and memory costs. PyTorch style pseudo-code for the core modules is provided in the supplementary materials.",

    "title": "Provable Benefits of Complex Parameterizations for Structured State Space Models",
    "author": "Yuval Ran-Milo, Eden Lumbroso, Edo Cohen-Karlik, Raja Giryes, Amir Globerson, Nadav Cohen",
    "summary": "Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.",
