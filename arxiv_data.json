    "summary": "Detecting small targets in infrared images poses significant challenges in defense applications due to the presence of complex backgrounds and the small size of the targets. Traditional object detection methods often struggle to balance high detection rates with low false alarm rates, especially when dealing with small objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines a contrario paradigm with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to improve Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). On the one hand, the integration of an a contrario criterion into a YOLO detection head enhances feature map responses for small and unexpected objects while effectively controlling false alarms. On the other hand, we explore SSL techniques to overcome the challenges of limited annotated data, common in IRSTD tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several representative SSL strategies for their effectiveness in improving small object detection performance. Our findings show that instance discrimination methods outperform masked image modeling strategies when applied to YOLO-based small object detection. Moreover, the combination of the a contrario and SSL paradigms leads to significant performance improvements, narrowing the gap with state-of-the-art segmentation methods and even outperforming them in frugal settings. This two-pronged approach offers a robust solution for improving IRSTD performance, particularly under challenging conditions.",

    "author": "Chen Hu, Yian Huang, Kexuan Li, Luping Zhang, Yiming Zhu, Yufei Peng, Tian Pu, Zhenming Peng",
    "summary": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is widely used in civilian and military applications. However, IRSTD encounters several challenges, including the tendency for small and dim targets to be obscured by complex backgrounds. To address this issue, we propose the Gradient Network (GaNet), which aims to extract and preserve edge and gradient information of small targets. GaNet employs the Gradient Transformer (GradFormer) module, simulating central difference convolutions (CDC) to extract and integrate gradient features with deeper features. Furthermore, we propose a global feature extraction model (GFEM) that offers a comprehensive perspective to prevent the network from focusing solely on details while neglecting the background information. We compare the network with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, and the results demonstrate that our method performs effectively.

    "summary": "Multimodal/vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly being deployed in healthcare settings worldwide, necessitating robust benchmarks to ensure their safety, efficacy, and fairness. Multiple-choice question and answer (QA) datasets derived from national medical examinations have long served as valuable evaluation tools, but existing datasets are largely text-only and available in a limited subset of languages and countries. To address these challenges, we present WorldMedQA-V, an updated multilingual, multimodal benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate VLMs in healthcare. WorldMedQA-V includes 568 labeled multiple-choice QAs paired with 568 medical images from four countries (Brazil, Israel, Japan, and Spain), covering original languages and validated English translations by native clinicians, respectively. Baseline performance for common open- and closed-source models are provided in the local language and English translations, and with and without images provided to the model. The WorldMedQA-V benchmark aims to better match AI systems to the diverse healthcare environments in which they are deployed, fostering more equitable, effective, and representative applications.",

    "title": "VividMed: Vision Language Model with Versatile Visual Grounding for Medicine",
    "author": "Lingxiao Luo, Bingda Tang, Xuanzhong Chen, Rong Han, Ting Chen",
    "summary": "Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable promise in generating visually grounded responses. However, their application in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For instance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas complex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while most VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The lack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these challenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual grounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic segmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various imaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage training procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open datasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in other common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation. Ablation studies empirically show that the integration of visual grounding ability leads to improved performance on these tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/function2-llx/MMMM.",

    "author": "Zihan You, Hao Wang, Qichao Zhao, Jinxiang Wang",
    "summary": "A stable 3D object detection model based on BEV paradigm with temporal information is very important for autonomous driving systems. However, current temporal fusion model use convolutional layer or deformable self-attention is not conducive to the exchange of global information of BEV space and has more computational cost. Recently, a newly proposed based model specialized in processing sequence called mamba has shown great potential in multiple downstream task. In this work, we proposed a mamba2-based BEV 3D object detection model named MambaBEV. We also adapt an end to end self driving paradigm to test the performance of the model. Our work performs pretty good results on nucences datasets:Our base version achieves 51.7% NDS. Our code will be available soon.",

    "title": "Adaptive Prompt Learning with SAM for Few-shot Scanning Probe Microscope Image Segmentation",
    "author": "Yao Shen, Ziwei Wei, Chunmeng Liu, Shuming Wei, Qi Zhao, Kaiyang Zeng, Guangyao Li",
    "summary": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong performance in image segmentation of natural scene images. However, its effectiveness diminishes markedly when applied to specific scientific domains, such as Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) images. This decline in accuracy can be attributed to the distinct data distribution and limited availability of the data inherent in the scientific images. On the other hand, the acquisition of adequate SPM datasets is both time-intensive and laborious as well as skill-dependent. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Prompt Learning with SAM (APL-SAM) framework tailored for few-shot SPM image segmentation. Our approach incorporates two key innovations to enhance SAM: 1) An Adaptive Prompt Learning module leverages few-shot embeddings derived from limited support set to learn adaptively central representatives, serving as visual prompts. This innovation eliminates the need for time-consuming online user interactions for providing prompts, such as exhaustively marking points and bounding boxes slice by slice; 2) A multi-source, multi-level mask decoder specifically designed for few-shot SPM image segmentation is introduced, which can effectively capture the correspondence between the support and query images. To facilitate comprehensive training and evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, SPM-Seg, curated for SPM image segmentation. Extensive experiments on this dataset reveal that the proposed APL-SAM framework significantly outperforms the original SAM, achieving over a 30% improvement in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient with only one-shot guidance. Moreover, APL-SAM surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation methods and even fully supervised approaches in performance. Code and dataset used in this study will be made available upon acceptance.",
