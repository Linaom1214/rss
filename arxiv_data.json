    "author": "Alina Ciocarlan, Sylvie Le H\u00e9garat-Mascle, Sidonie Lefebvre, Arnaud Woiselle",
    "summary": "Detecting small targets in infrared images poses significant challenges in defense applications due to the presence of complex backgrounds and the small size of the targets. Traditional object detection methods often struggle to balance high detection rates with low false alarm rates, especially when dealing with small objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines a contrario paradigm with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to improve Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). On the one hand, the integration of an a contrario criterion into a YOLO detection head enhances feature map responses for small and unexpected objects while effectively controlling false alarms. On the other hand, we explore SSL techniques to overcome the challenges of limited annotated data, common in IRSTD tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several representative SSL strategies for their effectiveness in improving small object detection performance. Our findings show that instance discrimination methods outperform masked image modeling strategies when applied to YOLO-based small object detection. Moreover, the combination of the a contrario and SSL paradigms leads to significant performance improvements, narrowing the gap with state-of-the-art segmentation methods and even outperforming them in frugal settings. This two-pronged approach offers a robust solution for improving IRSTD performance, particularly under challenging conditions.",

    "summary": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is widely used in civilian and military applications. However, IRSTD encounters several challenges, including the tendency for small and dim targets to be obscured by complex backgrounds. To address this issue, we propose the Gradient Network (GaNet), which aims to extract and preserve edge and gradient information of small targets. GaNet employs the Gradient Transformer (GradFormer) module, simulating central difference convolutions (CDC) to extract and integrate gradient features with deeper features. Furthermore, we propose a global feature extraction model (GFEM) that offers a comprehensive perspective to prevent the network from focusing solely on details while neglecting the background information. We compare the network with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, and the results demonstrate that our method performs effectively.

    "author": "Kajetan Schweighofer, Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez, Sepp Hochreiter, Nuria Oliver",
    "summary": "Ensembles of Deep Neural Networks, Deep Ensembles, are widely used as a simple way to boost predictive performance. However, their impact on algorithmic fairness is not well understood yet. Algorithmic fairness investigates how a model's performance varies across different groups, typically defined by protected attributes such as age, gender, or race. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the performance gains from Deep Ensembles and fairness. Our analysis reveals that they unevenly favor different groups in what we refer to as a disparate benefits effect. We empirically investigate this effect with Deep Ensembles applied to popular facial analysis and medical imaging datasets, where protected group attributes are given and find that it occurs for multiple established group fairness metrics, including statistical parity and equal opportunity. Furthermore, we identify the per-group difference in predictive diversity of ensemble members as the potential cause of the disparate benefits effect. Finally, we evaluate different approaches to reduce unfairness due to the disparate benefits effect. Our findings show that post-processing is an effective method to mitigate this unfairness while preserving the improved performance of Deep Ensembles.",

    "author": "Xiaodan Xing, Junzhi Ning, Yang Nan, Guang Yang",
    "summary": "Deep generative models have significantly advanced medical imaging analysis by enhancing dataset size and quality. Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models. All codes are https://github.com/junzhin/DGM-VLC.",

    "summary": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely applied in fields such as emergency response, owing to its advantages of rapid information acquisition and low cost. However, due to the effects of shooting distance and imaging mechanisms, the objects in the images present challenges such as small size, dense distribution, and low inter-class differentiation. To this end, we propose a multimodal remote sensing detection network that employs a quad-directional selective scanning fusion strategy called RemoteDet-Mamba. RemoteDet-Mamba simultaneously facilitates the learning of single-modal local features and the integration of patch-level global features across modalities, enhancing the distinguishability for small objects and utilizing local information to improve discrimination between different classes. Additionally, the use of Mamba's serial processing significantly increases detection speed. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RemoteDet-Mamba, which achieves superior detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter count.",

    "summary": "Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability to estimate uncertainty of imputation results. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.",

    "author": "Daniel Wolf, Tristan Payer, Catharina Silvia Lisson, Christoph Gerhard Lisson, Meinrad Beer, Michael G\u00f6tz, Timo Ropinski",
    "summary": "Self-supervised pre-training of deep learning models with contrastive learning is a widely used technique in image analysis. Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.",

    "summary": "Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains impacted by wave-front distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to those fundamental issues. As an experimental proof-of-concept, an in-vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheeps. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to drastically enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and non-ionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.",

    "author": "Zhenghao Pan, Haijin Zeng, Jiezhang Cao, Yongyong Chen, Kai Zhang, Yong Xu",
    "summary": "Color video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) employs computational imaging techniques to capture multiple sequential video frames in a single Bayer-patterned measurement. With the increasing popularity of quad-Bayer pattern in mainstream smartphone cameras for capturing high-resolution videos, mobile photography has become more accessible to a wider audience. However, existing color video SCI reconstruction algorithms are designed based on the traditional Bayer pattern. When applied to videos captured by quad-Bayer cameras, these algorithms often result in color distortion and ineffective demosaicing, rendering them impractical for primary equipment. To address this challenge, we propose the MambaSCI method, which leverages the Mamba and UNet architectures for efficient reconstruction of quad-Bayer patterned color video SCI. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first algorithm for quad-Bayer patterned SCI reconstruction, and also the initial application of the Mamba model to this task. Specifically, we customize Residual-Mamba-Blocks, which residually connect the Spatial-Temporal Mamba (STMamba), Edge-Detail-Reconstruction (EDR) module, and Channel Attention (CA) module. Respectively, STMamba is used to model long-range spatial-temporal dependencies with linear complexity, EDR is for better edge-detail reconstruction, and CA is used to compensate for the missing channel information interaction in Mamba model. Experiments demonstrate that MambaSCI surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational and memory costs.

    "summary": "Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.",

    "summary": "Image dehazing has drawn a significant attention in recent years. Learning-based methods usually require paired hazy and corresponding ground truth (haze-free) images for training. However, it is difficult to collect real-world image pairs, which prevents developments of existing methods. Although several works partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic datasets or small-scale real datasets. The haze intensity distribution bias and scene homogeneity in existing datasets limit the generalization ability of these methods, particularly when encountering images with previously unseen haze intensities. In this work, we present LMHaze, a large-scale, high-quality real-world dataset. LMHaze comprises paired hazy and haze-free images captured in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, spanning multiple scenarios and haze intensities. It contains over 5K high-resolution image pairs, surpassing the size of the biggest existing real-world dehazing dataset by over 25 times. Meanwhile, to better handle images with different haze intensities, we propose a mixture-of-experts model based on Mamba (MoE-Mamba) for dehazing, which dynamically adjusts the model parameters according to the haze intensity. Moreover, with our proposed dataset, we conduct a new large multimodal model (LMM)-based benchmark study to simulate human perception for evaluating dehazed images. Experiments demonstrate that LMHaze dataset improves the dehazing performance in real scenarios and our dehazing method provides better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "author": "Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao",
    "summary": "Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity.

    "summary": "Human action recognition (HAR) plays a key role in various applications such as video analysis, surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. Most HAR algorithms are developed from RGB images, which capture detailed visual information. However, these algorithms raise concerns in privacy-sensitive environments due to the recording of identifiable features. Event cameras offer a promising solution by capturing scene brightness changes sparsely at the pixel level, without capturing full images. Moreover, event cameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with complex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments. However, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially sparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these issues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability of Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high a temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of modeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive experiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45%, 7.22%, 0.15%, and 3.92% on the PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively.

Our proposal has been validated in the medical domain through a human-driven evaluation study where we compare the Bayesian Network Reasoning explanations obtained using factor arguments with an alternative explanation method.

This survey reviews the most relevant methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing. We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models. In addition, we present works that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models. We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. From this review, several conclusions emerge. In most cases, the textual modality achieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitive decline. Moreover, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.",

    "summary": "Efficient long-context language modeling remains a significant challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While Transformers dominate language tasks, they struggle with long sequences due to quadratic computational complexity in training and linearly scaling memory costs during inference. Recent State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer alternatives with constant memory usage, but they underperform in tasks requiring extensive in-context retrieval. We introduce Taipan, a novel hybrid architecture that combines Mamba-2 with Selective Attention Layers (SALs). These SALs identify tokens requiring long-range interactions, remove less important features, and then augment their representations using the attention module. This approach balances Mamba's efficiency with Transformer-like performance in memory-intensive tasks. By constraining the attention budget, Taipan extends accurate predictions to context lengths of up to 1 million tokens while preserving computational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate Taipan's superior performance across various scales and tasks, offering a promising solution for efficient long-context language modeling.",

    "summary": "Grading inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity using standardized histopathological scoring systems remains challenging due to resource constraints and inter-observer variability. In this study, we developed a deep learning model to classify activity grades in hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from patients with IBD, offering a robust approach for general pathologists. We utilized 2,077 WSIs from 636 patients treated at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in 2018 and 2019, scanned at 40x magnification (0.25 micron/pixel). Board-certified gastrointestinal pathologists categorized the WSIs into four activity classes: inactive, mildly active, moderately active, and severely active. A transformer-based model was developed and validated using five-fold cross-validation to classify IBD activity. Using HoVerNet, we examined neutrophil distribution across activity grades. Attention maps from our model highlighted areas contributing to its prediction. The model classified IBD activity with weighted averages of 0.871 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.860-0.883] for the area under the curve, 0.695 [95% CI: 0.674-0.715] for precision, 0.697 [95% CI: 0.678-0.716] for recall, and 0.695 [95% CI: 0.674-0.714] for F1-score. Neutrophil distribution was significantly different across activity classes. Qualitative evaluation of attention maps by a gastrointestinal pathologist suggested their potential for improved interpretability. Our model demonstrates robust diagnostic performance and could enhance consistency and efficiency in IBD activity assessment.",

    "author": "Sajjad Karimi, Shirin Karimi, Amit J. Shah, Gari D. Clifford, Reza Sameni",
    "summary": "Cardiovascular diseases are best diagnosed using multiple modalities that assess both the heart's electrical and mechanical functions. While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.   Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.   Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.   Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.",

The Transformer model has demonstrated success across a wide range of domains, including in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) where the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) has emerged as a leading algorithm in the field. However, a significant drawback of Transformer models is their quadratic computational complexity relative to input size, making them computationally expensive when scaling to larger inputs. This limitation restricts MAT's scalability in environments with many agents. Recently, State-Space Models (SSMs) have gained attention due to their computational efficiency, but their application in MARL remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the use of Mamba, a recent SSM, in MARL and assess whether it can match the performance of MAT while providing significant improvements in efficiency. We introduce a modified version of MAT that incorporates standard and bi-directional Mamba blocks, as well as a novel \"cross-attention\" Mamba block. Extensive testing shows that our Multi-Agent Mamba (MAM) matches the performance of MAT across multiple standard multi-agent environments, while offering superior scalability to larger agent scenarios. This is significant for the MARL community, because it indicates that SSMs could replace Transformers without compromising performance, whilst also supporting more effective scaling to higher numbers of agents.

    "author": "Xiaoman Liu",
    "summary": "CPU performance prediction, which involves forecasting the performance scores of a CPU based on its hardware characteristics during the operation process, is a critical technology for computational system design and resource management. However, this research field currently faces two significant challenges. First, collecting real-world data is challenging due to the wide variety of CPU products on the market and the highly specialized nature of relevant hardware characteristics. Second, existing methods based on hardware simulation models or machine learning exhibit notable shortcomings, such as lengthy simulation test cycles, low prediction accuracy, and the ignoration of characteristic correlations. To bridge these gaps, we first collect, preprocess, and standardize historical data from the 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors across multiple benchmark suites to create a new dataset, named PerfCastDB. Subsequently, we design a novel network MambaCPU (MaC) as the baseline for the PerfCastDB dataset. This model leverages the mamba structure to mine the global dependencies and correlations between multiple characteristics. The intra- and inter-group attention mechanisms are subsequently utilized to refine the correlations within and across the characteristic type groups. These techniques enhance the analysis and mining capability of Mac for the complex multivariate correlations. Comparative experiments on the PerfCastDB dataset demonstrate that MaC achieves superior results compared to existing methods, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we have open-sourced part of the dataset and the MaC code at \\url{https://github.com/xiaoman-liu/MaC} to facilitate the subsequent research.",

    "author": "Mirac Suzgun, Tayfun Gur, Federico Bianchi, Daniel E. Ho, Thomas Icard, Dan Jurafsky, James Zou",
    "summary": "As language models (LMs) become integral to fields like healthcare, law, and journalism, their ability to differentiate between fact, belief, and knowledge is essential for reliable decision-making. Failure to grasp these distinctions can lead to significant consequences in areas such as medical diagnosis, legal judgments, and dissemination of fake news. Despite this, current literature has largely focused on more complex issues such as theory of mind, overlooking more fundamental epistemic challenges. This study systematically evaluates the epistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and Llama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13 tasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false scenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle with recognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs contradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcare and counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, we identify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-person beliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to first-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth. Fifth, LMs rely on linguistic cues for fact-checking and sometimes bypass the deeper reasoning. These findings highlight significant concerns about current LMs' ability to reason about truth, belief, and knowledge while emphasizing the need for advancements in these areas before broad deployment in critical sectors.",

    "summary": "The utilization of longitudinal datasets for glaucoma progression prediction offers a compelling approach to support early therapeutic interventions. Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.",

    "summary": "Point cloud segmentation is an important topic in 3D understanding that has traditionally has been tackled using either the CNN or Transformer. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative, offering efficient long-range contextual modeling capabilities without the quadratic complexity associated with Transformer's attention mechanisms. However, despite Mamba's potential, early efforts have all failed to achieve better performance than the best CNN-based and Transformer-based methods. In this work, we address this challenge by identifying the key components of an effective and efficient point cloud segmentation architecture. Specifically, we show that: 1) Spatial locality and robust contextual understanding are critical for strong performance, and 2) Mamba features linear computational complexity, offering superior data and inference efficiency compared to Transformers, while still being capable of delivering strong contextual understanding. Additionally, we further enhance the standard Mamba specifically for point cloud segmentation by identifying its two key shortcomings. First, the enforced causality in the original Mamba is unsuitable for processing point clouds that have no such dependencies. Second, its unidirectional scanning strategy imposes a directional bias, hampering its ability to capture the full context of unordered point clouds in a single pass. To address these issues, we carefully remove the causal convolutions and introduce a novel Strided Bidirectional SSM to enhance the model's capability to capture spatial relationships. Our efforts culminate in the development of a novel architecture named MEEPO, which effectively integrates the strengths of CNN and Mamba. MEEPO surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method, PTv3, by up to +0.8 mIoU on multiple key benchmark datasets, while being 42.1% faster and 5.53x more memory efficient.",

We propose SepMamba, a U-Net-based architecture composed primarily of bidirectional Mamba layers. We find that our approach outperforms similarly-sized prominent models - including transformer-based models - on the WSJ0 2-speaker dataset while enjoying a significant reduction in computational cost, memory usage, and forward pass time.

Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.",

    "summary": "Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications.
